Version Control is a type of system that allows people to organize there files.
One of the benefits of using a Version Control system is that you can have
multiple people working on the same project and everyone can see what everyone
has done and why. One command that might be used is "git commit -m 'type commit
message here". This command is used to commit your work from your computer to
get it ready to go to a server. The message is what will appear when someone
goes looking for why certain changes were made so they need to have meaning.
